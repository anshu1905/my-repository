#Research Question1:
#First I want to explore from Main Survey - Section 2 - Healthy Days 
#Health-Related Quality of Life

#Variables will be used are:

#    physhlth: Number Of Days Physical Health Not Good
#    menthlth: Number Of Days Mental Health Not Good
#    poorhlth: Poor Physical Or Mental Health



#Ans
hist(brfss2013$physhlth,col="red",main="Number Of Days Physical Health Not Good")



#Research quesion 2:
#Second, I would like to see if there exists any relation between how many hours one sleeps and certain health conditions such as Heart Attack, Depressive Disorder etc.

#Variables will be used are:

 # sleptim1: How Much Time Do You Sleep
 # cvdinfr4: Ever Diagnosed With Heart Attack
 # addepev2: Ever Told You Had A Depressive Disorder.

#Ans
# Create a subset of data
vars <- names(brfss2013) %in% c("sleptim1", "cvdinfr4", "addepev2")
subdata <- brfss2013[vars]
# make a backup
subdata1 <- subdata
# convert factor levels into numeric levels
subdata1$addepev2 <- ifelse(subdata$addepev2=="Yes", 1, 0)
subdata1$cvdinfr4 <- ifelse(subdata$cvdinfr4=="Yes", 1, 0)
install.packages("Hmisc")
library("Hmisc")

subdata1 <- na.delete(subdata1)
# find correlation
cor(subdata1)
instal.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
M <- cor(subdata1)
corrplot(M, method="ellipse")

#1. Sleep time and Depressive Disorder has negative correlation, which mean if one sleeps less, chances for Depressive Disorder go high (this is not a causation, but just an initial inference). 
#2. Sleep time and Ever Diagnosed With Heart Attack shows almost no relation among them (corerlation is almost zero)


#Research Question 3:
#Lastly, I would like to see if health condition such as Heart Attack can be predicted using sleep time, Cholesterol, blood pressure etc.

#Variables I will be using for that are:

    #cvdinfr4: Ever Diagnosed With Heart Attack
    #bloodcho: Ever Had Blood Cholesterol Checked
    #cholchk: How Long Since Cholesterol Checked
    #toldhi2: Ever Told Blood Cholesterol High
    #bphigh4: Ever Told Blood Pressure High
    #sleptim1: How Much Time Do You Sleep

subdata1$bphigh4 <- as.factor(ifelse(subdata1$bphigh4=="Yes", "Yes", 
                           (ifelse(subdata1$bphigh4=="Yes, but female told only during pregnancy", "Yes",
                           (ifelse(subdata1$bphigh4=="Told borderline or pre-hypertensive", "Yes",
                                   "No"))))))
# table the data
summary(subdata1$bphigh4)

# Fit the logistic regression
fit <- glm(cvdinfr4 ~ ., data=subdata, family = "binomial")
print(fit)
summary(fit)

#From the summary we can analyse that sleeptime is a insignificant predictor value for heart attack prediction this is because P-value is greater than 0.05 (95% significance level)
#The others are very significant predictors for heart attack prediction.
