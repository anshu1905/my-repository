#The research question
#The analysis in this document is intended to answer the following research question based on the movies dataset: 
#Is there association between audience score and critics score and imdb_rating (The internet movie database rating). 
#Answering this question will help conform my assumption that critic rating can be reliably used to predict audince rating.
#These are the variables to be considered for EDA

#A statistical analysis using data from the movies dataset was conducted to determine if there is any association between audience score and critics score.
#The The results of the analysis suggest that there is strong positive linear relationship between critics score and audience score and critics score is a significant predictor of audience score. 
#This anaylysis shows that data on critics score can be used to predict audience satisfaction. 
#Using a more thorough analysis, Movie industries can uses similar results in producing movies that are more liked by the audience.
